<p>
    This example shows the client-side events supported by EasyUI Upload for ASP.NET MVC.
</p>
<p>
    You can attach an event handler using either of these options:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Specifiy the JavaScript event handler name:
        <pre class="prettyprint">
Html.EasyUI().Upload()
    .Name("attachments")
    .ClientEvents(events => events
        <em>.OnLoad("onLoad")</em>
    )
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Declare the event handler inline (WebForms syntax):
        <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;%= Html.EasyUI().Upload()
    .Name("attachments")
    .ClientEvents(events => events
       <em>.OnLoad(() => 
       {
        %&gt;
         function(e) {
             // Perform required actions here.
         }
        &lt;%
       }</em>
    )
%&gt;
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Declare the event handler inline (Razor syntax):
        <pre class="prettyprint">
@(Html.EasyUI().Upload()
    .Name("attachments")
    .ClientEvents(events => events
        <em>.OnLoad(
        @&lt;text&gt;
            function(e) {
                // Perform required actions here.
            }
        &lt;/text&gt;)</em>
    )
)
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The upload has the following events:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>OnLoad</em> - raised when the component is initialized
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>OnSelect</em> - raised when one or more files are selected (cancelable)
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>OnUpload</em> - raised when one or more files are about to be uploaded (cancellable)
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <em>OnError</em> - raised when an upload / remove operation has failed
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>OnComplete</em> - raised when all active uploads have completed either successfully or with errors
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>OnCancel</em> - raised when the upload has been cancelled while in progress
    </li>
