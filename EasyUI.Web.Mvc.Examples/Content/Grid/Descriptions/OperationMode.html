This example demonstrates the operation modes of EasyUI Grid for ASP.NET MVC Ajax binding.
</p>
<p>
By default EasyUI Grid for ASP.NET MVC will request data from the server every time the user changes the page, filters the grid, sorts or groups (<b>server operation mode</b>). 
When, <b>client operation mode</b> is enabled the grid will make only one request to the server and retrieve all data. After that all operations (paging, sorting, filtering and grouping) will be performed client-side. 
This would improve performance and will eliminate the need to hit the server for data.
</p>
<p>
To enable client operation mode you should use the <code>OperationMode</code> method: 
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
     Html.EasyUI().Grid(Model)
        .Name("Orders")
        .DataBinding(dataBinding =&gt; dataBinding
             .Ajax()
                   <b>.OperationMode(GridOperationMode.Client) // &lt;-- set the operation mode</b>
                   .Select("Select", "Home")
        )
        .Pageable()
        .Sortable()
</pre>
