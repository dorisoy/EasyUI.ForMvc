<p> This example shows the Editor component built-in image browser feature. </p>
<p>
Since the Q1 2011 release EasyUI Editor for ASP.NET MVC supports a new way of picking an image by browsing a list of predefined files and directories. Uploading new images is also supported. <br/>
</p>
<p>
The image browser needs a server side implementation (a controller) to retrieve the files and directories. A base controller class is provided by EasyUI. You can override some of its methods to customize the behavior. Alternatively, you can implement a completely custom controller without using the base class.
</p>
<p>Once the controller is setted up, you need to configure your editor for image browsing:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;%= Html.EasyUI().Editor()
        .Name("Editor")
        .FileBrowser(browser =&gt; browser.Browse("Browse", "ImageBrowser")
                              .Thumbnail("Thumbnail", "ImageBrowser")
                              .Upload("Upload", "ImageBrowser")
                              .DeleteFile("DeleteFile", "ImageBrowser")
                              .DeleteDirectory("DeleteDirectory", "ImageBrowser")
                              .CreateDirectory("CreateDirectory", "ImageBrowser"))
%&gt;
</pre>
