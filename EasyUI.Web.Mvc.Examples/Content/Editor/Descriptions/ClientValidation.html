    This example shows how EasyUI Editor for ASP.NET MVC is using build-in client validation of the ASP.NET MVC 2.0.
</p>
<p>
    Validation of the Model is based on the <em>DataAnnotations</em>. Except, all required actions to enable build-in client validation,
    important thing is that the editor should have the same name as the validated property of the Model. In other words
    if <strong>Notes</strong> is a property of the Model, editor should be named "Notes".
</p>
<p>
    Here is the definition of the <em>Notes</em> property, which is validated in this demo:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
        [Required]
        public string Notes
        {
            get;
            set;
        }
</pre>
<p>
    The <strong>[Required]</strong> attribute comes from the <em>System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</em>.
